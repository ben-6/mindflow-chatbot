Main entry of nginx is at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf which links the detailed
conf saved in /etc/nginx/conf.d/

sudo systemctl status nginx

sudo systemctl stop nginx

sudo systemctl start nginx


Try to start a local web server on 3000 port to see if nginx can redirect traffic
Ben/flask has a simple app which print out hello world

nginx logs are in /var/log/nginx/

Debug sequence: first check if nginx can redirect to a static html file. 
1. replace /etc/nginx/conf.d/nodeapp.conf with the following
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    root /var/www/html;  # Or your desired root directory

    # ... (rest of your configuration)
}
2. This block says, when a request to 80, serve pages from /var/www/html/ directory. 
3. go to the browser, type localhost/index.html, it should show the content from /var/www/html/index.html
4. type 192.1168.1.60/index.html, this shows the same content. 

Step 2: change the nodeapp.conf to redirect the request to location / to localhost:3000 which runs a flask server

1. replace /etc/nginx/conf.d/nodeapp.conf with the following
server {

  error_log /var/log/nginx/localhost.error_log debug;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/;
  }
}

server {

  listen 80;

  server_name api.mindflow.ai;
}


2. go to browser, type http://192.168.1.60/, it should show hello world which is served through the flask server in ~/Ben/flask/app.py
3. (to run the flask server, use python app.py)


Check which app is running and listening to a port: 
netstat -anpe | grep "5000" | grep "LISTEN"


curl http://localhost:5000/

curl -d '{"message": "test"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://192.168.1.60:80/api/
this command should return reasonable response if the notebook flask app works as expected.
